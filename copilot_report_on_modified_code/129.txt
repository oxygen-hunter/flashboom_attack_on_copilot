The provided Solidity code has several issues and potential vulnerabilities:

### Governmental Contract

1. **Outdated Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity version `^0.4.0`, which is outdated. It is recommended to use a more recent version of Solidity to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

2. **Constructor Syntax**: The constructor function `Governmental` uses the old syntax. In Solidity versions `0.4.22` and above, the `constructor` keyword should be used instead.

3. **Use of `throw`**: The `throw` statement is used for error handling, which is deprecated. It should be replaced with `require` or `revert`.

4. **Lack of Function Visibility**: The functions `Governmental`, `invest`, `resetInvestment`, and `attack` do not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.0`. This allows anyone to call them.

5. **Potential Reentrancy Attack**: The `resetInvestment` function sends Ether to `lastInvestor` and `owner` without using the `transfer` method, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.

6. **Unchecked Send**: The `send` method is used without checking its return value, which can lead to loss of Ether if the send fails.

7. **Hardcoded Time Interval**: The `ONE_MINUTE` variable is hardcoded, which reduces flexibility.

8. **Potential for Ether Loss**: If the contract receives Ether but the owner loses access to their account, the Ether could be permanently locked in the contract.

### Attacker Contract

1. **Recursive Call**: The `attack` function uses recursion, which can lead to out-of-gas errors if the recursion depth is too high.

2. **Lack of Function Visibility**: The `attack` function does not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.0`. This allows anyone to call it.

### wordbot and test Contracts

1. **Hardcoded Contract Address**: The `wordbot` contract address is hardcoded, which is not flexible and can lead to issues if the address changes.

2. **Unspecified Return Type**: The function `getWords` in the `wordbot` contract does not specify the return type correctly. It should return an array of `bytes6`.

3. **Inefficient String Conversion**: The conversion of `bytes6` to `string` in the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function is inefficient and can be optimized.

4. **Lack of Event Logging**: The contract does not log any events, which makes it difficult to track actions.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security and functionality of the contract.
