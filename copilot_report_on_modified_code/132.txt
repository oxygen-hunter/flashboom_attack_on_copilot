The provided Solidity code has several issues and potential vulnerabilities:

### MyToken Contract

1. **Outdated Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity version `^0.4.11`, which is outdated. It is recommended to use a more recent version of Solidity to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

2. **Constructor Syntax**: The constructor function `MyToken` uses the old syntax. In Solidity versions `0.4.22` and above, the `constructor` keyword should be used instead.

3. **Use of `tx.origin`**: The constructor assigns the initial balance to `tx.origin`, which is generally discouraged as it can lead to security issues. It is better to use `msg.sender`.

4. **Lack of Function Visibility**: The functions `MyToken`, `sendCoin`, and `getBalance` do not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.11`. This allows anyone to call them.

5. **Potential Reentrancy Attack**: The `sendCoin` function does not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.

6. **Event Emission**: The `Transfer` event is emitted without the `emit` keyword, which is required in Solidity `^0.4.21` and above.

### wordbot and test Contracts

1. **Hardcoded Contract Address**: The `wordbot` contract address is hardcoded, which is not flexible and can lead to issues if the address changes.

2. **Unspecified Return Type**: The function `getWords` in the `wordbot` contract does not specify the return type correctly. It should return an array of `bytes6`.

3. **Inefficient String Conversion**: The conversion of `bytes6` to `string` in the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function is inefficient and can be optimized.

4. **Lack of Event Logging**: The contract does not log any events, which makes it difficult to track actions.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security and functionality of the contract.
