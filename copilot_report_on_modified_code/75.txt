Based on the provided code, here are some potential issues and vulnerabilities:

1. **Outdated Solidity Version**: The code uses `pragma solidity ^0.4.24;`. This version is outdated and lacks many security improvements and features introduced in later versions.

2. **Unchecked External Call**: The `wordbot_contract.getWords(wordcount)` call in the `record_human_readable_blockhash` function does not check for success. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the call fails.

3. **Potential Reentrancy**: The `record_human_readable_blockhash` function makes an external call within a loop. This can lead to reentrancy attacks if the called contract is malicious or compromised.

4. **Gas Limit Considerations**: The `record_human_readable_blockhash` function involves a loop that iterates `wordcount` times. Ensure that the gas limit is considered, especially if `wordcount` is large. This might lead to out-of-gas errors.

5. **Modifier Logic**: The `one_time_use` modifier checks if the first element of `human_readable_blockhash` is an empty string. Ensure that this logic is correct and serves the intended purpose. If the `human_readable_blockhash` array is not properly initialized, this check might not work as expected.

6. **Visibility of Fallback Function**: The fallback function is not defined in the `ERC20` contract. Ensure that the fallback function is correctly defined to handle unexpected Ether transfers.

7. **Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow**: The code uses SafeMath for arithmetic operations, which is good practice. However, ensure that all arithmetic operations are covered by SafeMath to prevent integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities.

8. **Lack of Access Control**: The `record_human_readable_blockhash` function can be called by anyone. This might not be the intended behavior and can lead to unauthorized actions.

These are the primary concerns based on the provided code. To provide a more comprehensive audit, I would need to see the complete contract code and understand the context in which it is used.
