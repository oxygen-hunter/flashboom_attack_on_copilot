The provided Solidity code has several issues and potential vulnerabilities:

### Governmental Contract

1. **Outdated Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity version `^0.4.0`, which is outdated. It is recommended to use a more recent version of Solidity to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

2. **Constructor Syntax**: The constructor function `Governmental` uses the old syntax. In Solidity versions `0.4.22` and above, the `constructor` keyword should be used instead.

3. **Use of `throw`**: The `throw` statement is used for error handling, which is deprecated. It should be replaced with `require` or `revert`.

4. **Function Visibility**: The functions `Governmental`, `invest`, and `resetInvestment` do not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.0`. This allows anyone to call them.

5. **Unchecked Send**: The `send` method is used to transfer Ether without checking its return value. If the send fails, the contract will not handle the failure gracefully.

6. **Potential Reentrancy Attack**: The `resetInvestment` function transfers Ether to `lastInvestor` and `owner` before updating the state variables. This sequence can be exploited for reentrancy attacks.

7. **Time Manipulation**: The contract relies on `block.timestamp` for time-based logic, which can be manipulated by miners to some extent. This can affect the `resetInvestment` function.

8. **Hardcoded Time Interval**: The `ONE_MINUTE` variable is hardcoded, which reduces flexibility.

9. **Potential for Ether Loss**: If the contract receives Ether but the owner loses access to their account, the Ether could be permanently locked in the contract.

### Attacker Contract

1. **Recursive Call**: The `attack` function uses recursion, which can lead to out-of-gas errors if the recursion depth is too high.

2. **Function Visibility**: The `attack` function does not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.0`. This allows anyone to call it.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security and functionality of the contract.
