The provided Solidity code has several issues and potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Outdated Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity version `^0.4.15`, which is outdated. It is recommended to use a more recent version of Solidity to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

2. **Constructor Syntax**: The constructor function `DynamicPyramid` uses the old syntax. In Solidity versions `0.4.22` and above, the `constructor` keyword should be used instead.

3. **Use of `tx.origin`**: The constructor assigns the initial balance to `tx.origin`, which is generally discouraged as it can lead to security issues. It is better to use `msg.sender`.

4. **Lack of Function Visibility**: The functions `DynamicPyramid`, `collectAllFees`, `collectFeesInEther`, `collectPercentOfFees`, `changeOwner`, `changeMultiplier`, `changeFeePercentage`, and all constant functions do not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.15`. This allows anyone to call them.

5. **Use of `throw`**: The `throw` statement is used for error handling, which is deprecated. It should be replaced with `require` or `revert`.

6. **Potential Reentrancy Attack**: The `addPayout` function does not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern, which can lead to reentrancy attacks.

7. **Unchecked Send**: The `send` method is used without checking its return value, which can lead to loss of Ether if the send fails.

8. **Hardcoded Fee and Multiplier Values**: The fee and multiplier values are hardcoded, which reduces flexibility.

9. **Potential for Ether Loss**: If the contract receives Ether but the owner loses access to their account, the Ether could be permanently locked in the contract.

10. **Lack of Event Logging**: The contract does not log any events, which makes it difficult to track actions such as fee collection and ownership changes.

11. **Inconsistent Naming**: The contract is named `Rubixi`, but the constructor is named `DynamicPyramid`, which can be confusing.

12. **Potential Integer Overflow/Underflow**: The code does not use SafeMath for arithmetic operations, which can lead to integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security and functionality of the contract.
