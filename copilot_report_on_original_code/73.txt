The provided Solidity code has several issues and potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Outdated Solidity Version**: The code uses Solidity version `^0.4.16`, which is outdated. It is recommended to use a more recent version of Solidity to benefit from the latest security improvements and features.

2. **Function Visibility**: The functions `EthTxOrderDependenceMinimal`, `setReward`, and `claimReward` do not have visibility specified, which defaults to `public` in Solidity `^0.4.16`. This allows anyone to call them.

3. **Potential Front-Running Vulnerability**: The `claimReward` function is vulnerable to front-running attacks. An attacker can monitor the network for transactions calling `claimReward` and submit their own transaction with a higher gas price to claim the reward first.

4. **Unchecked Transfer**: The `transfer` method is used to send Ether without checking its return value. If the transfer fails, the contract will not handle the failure gracefully.

5. **Lack of Event Logging**: The contract does not log any events, which makes it difficult to track actions such as setting and claiming the reward.

6. **Potential Reentrancy Attack**: The `claimReward` function transfers Ether to the caller before updating the `claimed` state variable. This sequence can be exploited for reentrancy attacks.

7. **Hardcoded Submission Condition**: The `claimReward` function requires `submission < 10`, which is a hardcoded condition and may not be flexible enough for different use cases.

These issues should be addressed to improve the security and functionality of the contract.
